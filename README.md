Grabatar
========

Tiny JS library for grabbing Gravatar URLs from email addresses. This simply automates the md5 hashing and URL concatenation required for generating Gravatar URLs on the fly. I built this because I wanted to use Gravatar from within JS templates.

See the demo.html file for usage.
